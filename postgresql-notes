# PostgreSQL Notes

Originally, we used MongoDB to hold the content for locations and mailstops. Over time, it has become evident that it might be easier to maintain the common names in a SQL table that could be fed back to CPSM and FacilitiesLink.
Also, we store other map related OSM data on the host postgres-osm.ucsc.edu and adding some tables wasn't a lot of work.

# PostgreSQL + NodeJS REST API

We'll cut over our existing API to use the PostgreSQL backend. I'm supplementing with info from this tutorial:
