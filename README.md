UCSC added street names in September 2010. In 2015 all buildings, received official street addresses. 

Building names and common names change over time. Open spaces and parking lots need to have addresses for Clery reporting.

How do we teach student techs that Frida Kahlo Apartments is also known as Oakes College Residence A11 12 aka 7407?

How does a Police incident report know that parking lot 140 is aka 400 Foundry Road?

We're working on a MEAN stack app and API that uses authoritative CAAN sources, OpenStreetMaps and our building addresses to present a "cross walk" app that filters records and provides basic locative info.
